## Running the Application Locally

Firstly, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ryanDing26/asgs-webmaster-challenge.git
```

Then, change directories into the repository:

```bash
cd ./asgs-webmaster-challenge/
```

Directions for installing npm can be found [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/install) if not yet installed as they are required for the next portion.

Then, install the npm dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

After that, run the application with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Now, you can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
